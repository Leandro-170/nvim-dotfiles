# Neovim config!

- Requires Neovim 0.8+
- Uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim). The config will attempt to get Lazy for you if you don't have it already - See [plugins.lua](lua/plugins.lua).
- Catppuccin is the default theme (also the best) but some other great themes are installed as well.
- Beware, the commit names don't make any sense.
